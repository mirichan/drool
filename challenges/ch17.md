## Challenge 1

```trace
compile {
    advance()
    expression {
        parse_precedence(Assignment) {
            grouping() {
                expression() {
                    parse_precedence(Assignment) {
                        unary() [-] {
                            parse_precedence(Unary) {
                                number(); // 1
                            }
                        }
                        binary() [+] {
                            parse_precedence(Term + 1 == Factor) {
                                number(); // 2
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            binary() [*] {
                parse_precedence(Factor + 1 == Unary) {
                    number(); // 3
                }
            }
            binary() [-] {
                parse_precedence(Term + 1 == Factor) {
                    unary() [-] {
                        parse_precedence(Unary) {
                            number(); // 4
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


```

## Challenge 2

-   Can't see any more in Lox???
-   `*` in C (pointer derefs and multiplication)
-   `+` in JS (unary plus is a no-op on numbers but can coerce other values, binary plus adds with coersion)

## Note

I feel attacked by this design note:

> Later, the functional programming folks got into parser combinators, packrat parsers, and other sorts of things. Because, obviously, if you give a functional programmer a problem, the first thing theyâ€™ll do is whip out a pocketful of higher-order functions.

A parser combinator system architecture is exactly what I want ðŸ˜­

## Challenge 3

Scalaz had to define this itself (`?|`), and used a low precedence, so I guess we need to define one of those, above assignment. That tallies with my experience in lots of languages where it's baked in too.

I'm way too tired to be interesting in reasoning about how I'd implement it in this confusing imperative mess.
