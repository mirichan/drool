# Chapter 18 challenges

## Challenge 1

> We could reduce our binary operators even further than we did here. Which other instructions can you eliminate, and how would the compiler cope with their absence?

-   Multiply: we could implement it with addition and looping once we have it
-   Minus (we could implement it with addition and negation right now)
-   Either:
    -   One of GT/LT/EQ: any one can be derived from the others
    -   All of GT/LT/EQ: they can be replaced with a single compare operation with a three-valued return type

## Challenge 2

> Conversely, we can improve the speed of our bytecode VM by adding more specific instructions that correspond to higher-level operations. What instructions would you define to speed up the kind of user code we added support for in this chapter?

-   Common operations: `inc`, `dec`
-   As noted in the chapter: `>=` and `<=`
-   More constants: `true`, `false` and `nil` are great, but `0`, `-1` and `1` are common too.
