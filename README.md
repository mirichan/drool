# drool 🤤

A work-in-progress [lox 🐟](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) bytecode interpreter, written in Rust 🦀.

"Drool" because crab stuffed salmon is an insanely decadent, guilty pleasure which produces this response.

This project likely won't do that, as it's my first foray into the language.
